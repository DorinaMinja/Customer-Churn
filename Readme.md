# Project Customer Churn

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using a machine learning model. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to stop using a service and take proactive measures to retain them.


## Project Overview
Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses to understand the reasons behind customer attrition and to develop strategies for customer retention. This project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and prediction.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing the distribution of features, identifying correlations, and uncovering patterns.
- Model Training: Building and evaluating various machine learning models to predict churn.
- Prediction: Using the trained model to predict churn on new data.
- Performance Metrics: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
